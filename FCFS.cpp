// implementation file for FCFS. 

// I was thinking we had a file like this for each of the algo's 
// then perhaps we could have a file for the Queues -- ready, waiting, etc.
// and then have a file for the final caluclations? It depends on how you guys
// want to do it. We can easily create/delete these branches on git, if you all want.

// we could also have another file for receiving the arguments and whatnot,
// and calls whatever it needs to perform the calculations and whatnot for awt, 
// then returns the awt to main, to keep main pretty.
